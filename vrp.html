        <h1>Vehicle Routing Problem solver and visualizer</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>This is an interactive tool for solving and visualizing a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem">Vehicle Routing Problem</a> 
        (VRP) called the Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (DPDPTW). See the code <a href="https://github.com/pmaatta/vrp">here</a>. <button class="info">Show/hide instructions</button> </p>
      </div>

      <div class="instructions" hidden>
        <p>
          With this tool, DPDPTW problem instances can be generated either manually or randomly, and these instances can then be solved (using Google's 
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">OR-tools</a> as the solver) and the solutions can be displayed and animated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In a DPDPTW, a group of vehicles must satisfy a collection of customer requests. Each customer request requires the use of a single vehicle to both to load 
          a specified amount of goods at one location and to deliver them to another location. All requests must be performed without violating either the vehicle 
          capacity or the customer time window stipulated at each location. The goal is to find optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to visit the pickup and delivery locations. 
          The dynamic element is in the form of new customer requests that arrive as the planned routes are already being carried out. 
          These new requests must also be incorporated into the existing routes for the vehicles, meaning that the planned routes for one or more vehicles must change.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin using the tool, first click '<b>Generate random problem</b>'. (If things look messy, you can reduce the number of cars and pickups and generate new problems 
          as well as toggle 'Use time windows'.) What you see now is an instance of a PDPTW problem. Black circles are vehicles, blue circles are nodes that have to be 
          visited by vehicles, and the black square is the depot (which can be ignored for now). Red arrows are drawn from pickup nodes to their corresponding delivery 
          nodes - this means that a single vehicle must visit both nodes and the pickup node must be visited before the delivery node. The numbers in brackets indicate
          the allowed time window for visiting each node. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now click '<b>Solve</b>'. This solves the PDPTW instance, meaning that routes for the vehicles are found which yield the minimum cost in terms of the objective 
          function while observing all of the constraints of the problem. Solution information becomes available after some seconds (or more if the generated instance
          is very large) at the bottom below the canvas. If the problem was solved successfully, 'Display routes' is enabled. (If not, generate a new problem and try
          again.) 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now click '<b>Display routes</b>'. This shows the routes for each vehicle in the solution to the PDPTW instance. Then, click on '<b>Advance time</b>'. This animates
          the vehicles going through their routes as time passes. (If the vehicles do not start moving immediately, this is due to the nodes having time windows which
          do not allow visiting them too early, so the vehicles must wait for a while before moving.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, while the vehicles are still moving after having pressed 'Advance time', press '<b>Pause</b>' to stop time. Then, click on the canvas in two different spots.
          This should create a new pickup-delivery request, illustrating the dynamic nature of the VRP variant. Now press '<b>Solve</b>' again to solve the introduced dynamic 
          problem. After solving you can again display and animate the routes which have changed due to the added nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above illustrates the basic use of the tool with random problem generation, but problem instances can also be generated manually. This is done by selecting 
          the type of node from the '<b>Add nodes</b>' selector and clicking on the canvas to place the node. (You can clear the current problem instance with '<b>Clear</b>'.) 
          Each instance requires the insertion of one or more vehicles (cars), at least one node to be visited, and one depot. Visit nodes can be either pickup-delivery node 
          pairs or task nodes, which are singular nodes that have to be visited. Vehicles take a longer time to service task nodes than other nodes; the service time is indicated
          below the node which is denoted by a triangle. 
        </p>
